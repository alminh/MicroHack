Duration: 50 minutes

[Previous Challenge Solution](../challenge-2/solution.md) - **[Home](../../Readme.md)** - [Next Challenge Solution](../challenge-4/solution.md)

## Prerequisites

Please ensure that you successfully passed [challenge 2](../../Readme.md#challenge-2) before continuing with this challenge.

In this Challenge, you will learn how to protect Azure VM with Azure Site Recovery, and enable replication to the secondary site. Moreover, you will successfully run the test & production failover and failback between two regions.

Actions

* Set up and enable disaster recovery with Azure Site Recovery and monitor the progress
* Perform a disaster recovery drill, create recovery plan and run a test failover 
* Run a production failover from EU West to EU East region and Failback again to the EU West region (Source environment) and monitor the progress

## Task 1: Enable replication with Azure Site recovery for the Virtual Machine in the West Europe Region to the North Europe Region

Navigate to **Recovery Services Vault** in the North Europe (mh-rsv-neu) which we created in the first Challenge. In the **Protected Items**, select **Replicated Items**. Then select **Replicate** and from the dropdown list select **Azure virtual machines**. The following pan will apprear:

### Run the failback for server01 from Europe North to West
You can't fail back the VM until the replication has completed, and synchronization is 100% completed. The synchronization process can take several minutes to complete.
After the Synchronization completes, select **Failover**.
